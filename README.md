# Minimal Containers for Databricks Container Services

The dockerfile is based on the official
[databricks/containers](https://github.com/databricks/containers) repository.
Installed ubuntu packages and python libraries are kept to the minimum required
to be used for Databricks Container Services and support the necessary features.

The containers have been tested and verified to work. 
They are suitable to be used as base images 
to install libraries required for your use cases.
