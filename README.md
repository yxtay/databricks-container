# Minimal Container Images for Databricks Container Service

The dockerfile is based on the official
[databricks/containers](https://github.com/databricks/containers) repository.
Installed ubuntu packages and python libraries are kept to the minimum required
to be used for Databricks Container Service and support the necessary features.

The container images have been tested and verified to work.
They are suitable to be used as base images
to install libraries required for your use cases.

## Availabe Images
